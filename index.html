<p>Typically, Vietnamese uses hands to eat spring roll. This is a compact food, which is healthy, light, goes with slavory home-made hoisin sauce. </p>
<p> Cook shrimps and pork well. Fry the egg and cut to small pieces. Noodle also cook well. Then wet the rice paper, start to place all ingredients nicely. Try to roll as neat as you can. First it can be trick. Once you master it, then I will be proud. That's it. You have your perfect rolls. </p>
<p>Making sauce is an art. Because I can not tell exactly how much flavor should you pour in the sauce. Let's trust your gut. So, boil hoisin paste with some water, add little fish sauce, fried garlic and chilli. Here you go, nice sauce. Enjoy. Thanks</p>
